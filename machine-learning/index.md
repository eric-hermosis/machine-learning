# Welcome!

This website is dedicated to sharing my ongoing theoretical research in machine learning. It is intended as a **living repository of ideas**, evolving over time as I expand on my work.  

Here, you will find a series of individual notes, preprints and publications that explore various aspects of modern machine learning theory under a physics perspective. Each article is meant to stand on its own but collectively, they aim to grow into a cohesive, evolving “living book” of machine learning insights.

## Topics

- **Learning Dynamics**  

    The work presents a fundamental theory of artificial learning as a thermodynamic process in which models evolve according to the information they perceive.
